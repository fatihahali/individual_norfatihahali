			<h1 style="color:white" class="text-title">About</h1>
			<p style="color:white">My name is NORFATIHAH BINTI MOHD ALI. I am a UITM student. I am 21 years old. I was born in 18th January 2001. 
			I stay in Penang. I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. 
			Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new 
			interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at university: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and 
			ready to help. My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. 
			As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. 
			I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting 
			things about each other and experience new things.I appreciate friendship and people who surround me. 
			Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies 
			gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. 
			Iâ€™m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. 
			I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by emails or in 
			social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting 
			somewhere in the park. In this way, Liza became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies 
			the same classes and we have similar life goals.</p>
